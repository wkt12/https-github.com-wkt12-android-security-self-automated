Android Security &amp; Defense System 

Cybersecurity is like the digital armor that protects our connected lives. 🛡️ It’s the practice of defending computers, networks, mobile devices, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. Whether you're a solo developer like you, Mark, or part of a global enterprise, cybersecurity is essential to keeping systems safe and trustworthy.

🔍 Core Concepts of Cybersecurity
- Confidentiality: Keeping sensitive data private and accessible only to authorized users.
- Integrity: Ensuring data isn’t altered or tampered with.
- Availability: Making sure systems and data are accessible when needed.

⚠️ Common Threats
- Malware: Includes viruses, ransomware, spyware—malicious software that can damage or steal data.
- Phishing: Deceptive emails or messages that trick users into revealing personal info.
- DDoS Attacks: Overwhelming a system with traffic to make it crash.
- Zero-Day Exploits: Attacks that target unknown vulnerabilities before they’re patched.

🧰 Key Defenses
- Firewalls: Block unauthorized access to networks.
- Antivirus Software: Detects and removes malicious code.
- Encryption: Scrambles data so it’s unreadable without a key.
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds extra layers of identity verification.

🚀 Cybersecurity in Action
For a project like WKT12 Android Security, you might be:
- Scanning APKs for vulnerabilities
- Setting up honeypots to detect intrusions
- Automating patching or hardening routines
- Monitoring logs for suspicious behavior
